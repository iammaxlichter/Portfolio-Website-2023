                    split ourselves into two teams, front-end & back-end development.
                    I opted for the front-end team as front-end is something I enjoy very much and was looking to expand
                    my skillset in.

                    We coded MyMuse using Flutter as our framework, Dart as our programming language, Firebase
                    to store the user information, Apple Music API for our search and upload song feature, and Android
                    Studio Emulator to see our progress as we coded. We had 12 weeks to create our fully functional app,
                    and at the end of said 12 weeks, we presented our project to hundreds of students, parents, and
                    peers. Along with that, we were also judged by a group of judges that work inside the tech industry,
                    with companies such as Chase, Capital One, and AT&T. The video to the right is known as
                    "Presentation Night", and it's exactly how it sounds. all 10 teams gather together to share what
                    they created in the past 12 weeks.
