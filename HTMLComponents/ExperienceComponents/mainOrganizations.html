                    ACM, or the Association of Computing Machinery is the largest Computer Science organization at UT
                    Dallas. In the Fall 2022 Semester, I was a part of a very sought after sub-division of ACM known as
                    ACM Projects.
                    <br><br>
                    Inside ACM, I engaged in countless discussions relating to coding events such as hackathons
                    in the
                    area, code / tech-related tournaments, and technical workshops analyzing areas of CS. Along wit
                    that, I also taught and helped peers understand their work / programming language they were
                    interested in and established mutualistic bonds across the computing community at UTD.

                        CSG, or Computer Security Group is an organization at UT Dallas that is specialized, (but not
                        limited to) Computer / Cyber security.
                        <br><br>
                        Every Wednesday of the week, an officer of CSG, and or someone who volunteered to talk will give
                        a 1
                        hour presentation on any tech related subject. These discussions explored studies in computing
                        security topics such as data recovery, compromised credentials, and big tech. As well as the
                        weekly
                        discussions, we confer with each other afterwards over the many ways to get into the cyber
                        security
                        professional field.

                        From UX Club, i've gotten the chance to engage in many areas of UX, such as the ability to

                        ability to support and collaborate with my peers on design feedback, network, develop
