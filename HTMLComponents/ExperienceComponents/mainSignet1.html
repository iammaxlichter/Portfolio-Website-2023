                    <span class="font-italic">Atlassian Jira</span> to learn the ins and outs of <span

                    Right from the first orientation to the last minutes of my internship, Signet was a true melting pot
                    of knowledge. As time progressed, I gained more and more knowledge about <span
                        class="font-weight-bold">quality assurance</span> and the
                    complexities of the <span class="font-italic">software development life cycle</span>. Additionally,
                    the experience gave me the chance
                    to develop critical <span class="font-italic">communication and collaboration skills</span> as I
                    collaborated with my coworkers to
                    take on challenging tasks and achieve strict deadlines. Even though I don't have many pictures, the
                    experiences I had and the insights I learned while working at Signet will always be cherished in the
                    chronicles of my career.
