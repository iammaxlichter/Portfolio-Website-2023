                    I started this project in the Summer of 2022. I was at a standpoint at my love for Computer Science
                    and school had just let out. With me being bored and interviewing for a Summer job in my hometown, I
                    decided I need a website to keep track of all of my professional achievements / acolades and thus,
                    this website was born.

                    By absolutely no means is this project nearly where I want to be in terms of development, but by
                    creating this webpage, I dramatically increased my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    Re-learning these languages I used 4+ years ago in highschool was incredibly fun. Even though this
                    project is always a work in progress, I'm super happy with the outcome. I'll constantly be updating
                    & changing things on this webpage, & on the left is pictures concerning the process of creating this
                    project.
