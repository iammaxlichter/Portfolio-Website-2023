                    I'm happy to announce that in the summer of 2024, I'll be working as a software development
                    intern again at Signet Jewelers. I had a great time at my last internship, and I'm excited to
                    learn more about the software development industry at this prestigious company. As I continue to
                    develop both personally and professionally, I'm excited to share my knowledge and pick up tips
                    from the amazing staff at Signet.

                <p class="slide-in-bottom text-left">
                    I see this as an opportunity to add significant value to Signet's projects and expand my
                    knowledge of software development, with an emphasis on real-world issues and practical learning.
                    I'm excited to get started and welcome any fresh perspectives and experiences this next
                    internship may provide.
