                    at UT Dallas, there exists an organization known as ACM or the "Association of Computing Machinery."
                    ACM is built upon five separate divisions. One of those divisions is known as ACM Projects. ACM
                    Projects is a semester-long guided project initiative for those new to software development,
                    teaching collaborative tools, new technologies, and core development principles complimentary to
                    undergraduate curriculum. MyMuse was one of 10 unique projects (consisting of 4-5 people) in Fall
                    2022's rendition of ACM Projects.
                    <br><br> To summarize what our app does, MyMuse is a social media platform app that allows you to
                    share music with you friends at any random point in the day, can show you what your friends are
                    listening to at the moment, and allow you to comment on your friends post's as well. The idea for
                    MyMuse was created by my groups project manager <a
                        href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faiza-rahman301/" target="_blank">Faiza Rahman</a>. Faiza was
                    my teammates and I's
                    guidance along the way and really helped us develop a total understanding of what we were creating.

                    I, along with my fellow co-creators

                    split ourselves into two teams, front-end & back-end development.
                    I opted for the front-end team as front-end is something I enjoy very much and was looking to expand
                    my skillset in.


                    <br><br>
                    We coded MyMuse using Flutter as our framework, Dart as our programming language, Firebase
                    to store the user information, Apple Music API for our search and upload song feature, and Android
                    Studio Emulator to see our progress as we coded. We had 12 weeks to create our fully functional app,
                    and at the end of said 12 weeks, we presented our project to hundreds of students, parents, and
                    peers. Along with that, we were also judged by a group of judges that work inside the tech industry,
                    with companies such as Chase, Capital One, and AT&T. The video to the right is known as
                    "Presentation Night", and it's exactly how it sounds. all 10 teams gather together to share what
                    they created in the past 12 weeks.

                        MyMuse was an unforgetable experience and is my proudest achievement in my short career inside
                        Computer Science. I learned not only the essentials of creating a fully functional mobile app,
                        but I
                        also learned how to work around 5 different schedules, how to resolve conflicts in coding, AND
                        with
                        my teammates, and I learned the most important skill of all... adapting to my situation. There
                        were
                        so many times where something went wrong with MyMuse, but nonetheless, we get the job done and
                        all
                        became better Computer Scientists, Software Engineers, and people from it.
