                    At UT Dallas, there exists an organization known as <span class="font-weight-bold">ACM</span> or the
                    <span class="font-italic">"Association of Computing Machinery."</span>
                    ACM is built upon five separate divisions. One of those divisions is known as ACM Projects. ACM
                    Projects is a semester-long guided project initiative for those new to software development,
                    teaching collaborative tools, new technologies, and core development principles complimentary to
                    undergraduate curriculum. MyMuse was one of 10 unique projects (consisting of 4-5 people) in Fall
                    2022's rendition of ACM Projects.

                    To summarize what our app does, <span class="font-weight-bold">MyMuse is a social media platform app
                        that allows you to
                        share music with you friends at any random point in the day, can show you what your friends are
                        listening to at the moment, and allow you to comment on your friends post's as well.</span> The
                    idea for
                    MyMuse was created by my groups project manager <a

                    my teammates and I's
                    guidance along the way and really helped us develop a total understanding of what we were creating.

                    I opted for the front-end team as front-end is something I enjoy very much and was looking to expand

                    functional app,
                    and at the end of said 12 weeks, we presented our project to hundreds of students, parents, and
                    peers. Along with that, we were also judged by a group of judges that work inside the tech industry,
                    with companies such as Chase, Capital One, and AT&T. The video to the right is known as
                    "Presentation Night", and it's exactly how it sounds. all 10 teams gather together to share what
                    they created in the past 12 weeks.

                    One of the most significant parts of my recent trip through the halls of Computer Science is my work
                    with MyMuse. Throughout this ordeal, I not only explored the complexities of creating a useful
                    mobile application but also managed my diverse team through the maze of competing schedules and code
                    conundrums. The experience was more than just troubleshooting code; it was a harmonious blend of
                    cooperation, handling conflict, and flexible thinking. Even with the unavoidable setbacks, we
                    persisted and came out stronger as people and programmers as a result of facing the trials and
                    tribulations of real life. <br>
