                    During my Junior year at UT Dallas, I had the wonderful opportunity to be a part of something bigger
                    than myself. With that being said, I enrolled in a course called EPICS or <span
                        class="font-italic font-weight-bold">"Engineering Projects in Community Service."</span> EPICS
                    is a semester-long
                    service learning program that lets students work on real problems while addressing the needs within
                    the local or global community. Through this program, non-profit organizations partner with a team of
                    UT Dallas students receive the technical expertise they need to solve a problem that greatly
                    benefits the community.

                    Over the whole semester, my teammates and I bonded, learned, and developed into a
                    productive unmatched coding machine. We split the team up into three separate teams. Two on
                    front-end <span class="font-italic">(me included)</span>, two on back-end, and two full stack
                    developers. We had some bumps in the road when coding this website with its full
                    functionality, but the end product is something that we never could've imagined.

                    Our team successfully coded a working database with a <span class="font-weight-bold">log-in and sign
                        up system, a working queue system, a scoreboard to actively keep a record of the game, and a
                        fully
                        functional live steam of the robots clashing themselves.</span>
                    This project taught all of us how to collaborate and work efficiently as a team together, as well as
                    giving us the confidence that we produced such complex software. The final product of our creation
                    is in a slideshow to the right side, along with many pictures from the whole experience.
